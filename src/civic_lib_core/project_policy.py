    Load Civic Interconnect project policy, allowing client repos to
    optionally override default settings via a custom policy file.

    The default policy is loaded from the library's internal `project_policy.yaml`.
    If `project_root` is provided and a `project_policy.yaml` exists within it,
    this custom policy will be loaded and its values will be recursively
    merged into the default policy, overriding any conflicting keys.
