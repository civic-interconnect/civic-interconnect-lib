Provides common reusable functions used by multiple agents in the Civic Interconnect project.

## Key Design Rules

- This package is for widely shared functionality only.
- Each agent using this library remains independent.
- Code in the library must be:
  - Stateless
  - Simple
  - Easy to maintain
- The library contains cross-cutting helpers such as:
  - API key loading
  - Config loading
  - Query execution (GraphQL pagination)
  - Exception handling
  - Logging setup
